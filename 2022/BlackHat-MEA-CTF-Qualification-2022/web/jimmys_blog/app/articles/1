A future without passwords

So many years have passed since the internet was created, so why do we still stick with password based authentication?

The answer is simple, it's because people are lazy to change.
Well, let me start off by saying that I don't hate passwords.
I know the concept of password security.
I know that it's good practice, but I'm going to go ahead and admit that I use the same passwords for everything and I've simply forgotten them for various websites.
So if the scenario below happens, I'm in trouble because I don't remember the combination for a password.
This is an actual test that I took to see what the password for apple.com would be.
I hope the joke works, otherwise I apologize for being a lame comedian.
This is a common practice in online security.
The security software at the server stores the actual password in encrypted form, and stores a different unique password for each client.
When the computer processes the request, the password is compared to the encryption key.
If they match, the computer assumes that it's the original user, and that the original password hasn't changed.
If they don't match, the computer doesn't display the website.
